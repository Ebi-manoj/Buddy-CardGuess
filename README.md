# Buddy the Card Guesser

Buddy the Card Guesser is a fun and interactive JavaScript-based game where the user thinks of a card out of 16 displayed options, and Buddy guesses the correct card with precision! This project demonstrates logical thinking, user interaction, and programming skills in a simple yet engaging way.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: The user selects a card mentally, and Buddy guesses it correctly.
- **Simple UI**: A clean and intuitive interface makes the game easy to play.
- **JavaScript Logic**: Utilizes core JavaScript concepts to implement the card-guessing functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the game interface.
- **CSS**: For styling and enhancing the visual appeal.
- **JavaScript**: For the card-guessing logic and user interaction.

## How It Works

1. The user is shown a set of 16 cards on the screen.
2. They are asked to think of one card (without revealing it).
3. Through a series of steps or questions, Buddy determines the card.
